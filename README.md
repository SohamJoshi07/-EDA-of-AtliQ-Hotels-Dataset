# -EDA-of-AtliQ-Hotels-Dataset
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a fictional hotel chain, AtliQ Hotels, to uncover insights about occupancy rates, revenue trends, and city-wise performance using Python and popular data analysis libraries.

📊 Project Objectives
Understand the structure and quality of the AtliQ Hotels dataset
Clean and preprocess the data for analysis
Transform data into meaningful formats
Answer key business questions such as:
What is the average occupancy rate by room category?
How does occupancy vary by city and across weekdays vs weekends?
What is the revenue distribution across cities and months?

🔍 Key Insights
Occupancy by Room Category: Calculated average occupancy rate for different room categories to identify underperforming segments.
City-wise Occupancy: Compared city performances to identify where occupancy is the highest.
Weekday vs Weekend Trends: Analyzed occupancy trends across weekdays and weekends to assist in dynamic pricing strategies.
June City-wise Occupancy: Focused analysis on the month of June to find seasonal variations.
Revenue per City: Measured the total revenue generated by each city to identify high-earning locations.
Monthly Revenue Trends: Visualized revenue trends month-over-month to support financial forecasting.
